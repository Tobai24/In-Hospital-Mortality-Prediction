# Setup

Welcome to the workflow setup guide! ðŸŽ‰ Follow these steps to get everything up and running:

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**

   First, youâ€™ll want to move into the directory where you cloned the repository:

   ```bash
   cd mlops
   ```

2. **Start Mage and the Database Service:**

   Next, launch Mage and PostgreSQL by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```

   This command will start both MLflow and Mage, which you can then access through your web browser.

3. **Access Mage and MLflow:**

   After starting the services, open your browser and visit the following URLs:

   **Mage**: [http://localhost:6789](http://localhost:6789)  
     Here, you can view and manage your pipelines.

     - click on the dashboard to view the dashboard
     - click on trigger to see the trigger run setup

   **MLflow**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
