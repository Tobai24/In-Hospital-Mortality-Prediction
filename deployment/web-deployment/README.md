## **Run Your App Locally with Docker**

Letâ€™s start by getting your Streamlit app up and running on your local machine.

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   - Navigate to the `deployment/web-deployment` directory in your terminal:
     ```bash
     cd deployment/web-deployment
     ```
   - Build your Docker image using the following command:
     ```bash
     docker build -t streamlit-app:latest .
     ```

2. **Run the Docker Container Locally:**
   - After building the image, run your Streamlit app in a Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit-app:latest
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to see your app in action.

## **Set Up Google Cloud Platform**

Now, letâ€™s prepare your Google Cloud environment to deploy your app.

1. **Create a Google Cloud Account and Project:**
   - Sign in to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), and create a new project. Note down the **Project ID**.

2. **Enable Cloud Run and Cloud Build APIs:**
   - Go to **APIs & Services** > **Library** and enable both **Cloud Run** and **Cloud Build** for your project.

3. **Install Google Cloud SDK:**
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK on your machine:
     ```bash
     curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
     exec -l $SHELL
     gcloud init
     ```
   - Authenticate and set up your project with the `gcloud init` command.

## **Tag and Push Docker Image to Google Cloud**

Letâ€™s get your Docker image ready for Google Cloud.

1. **Authenticate Docker with Google Cloud:**
   - Run the following command to configure Docker for Google Cloud:
     ```bash
     gcloud auth configure-docker
     ```

2. **Tag the Docker Image:**
   - Tag your image for Google Container Registry:
     ```bash
     docker tag streamlit-app:latest gcr.io/<your-project-id>/streamlit-app:latest
     ```
   - Replace `<your-project-id>` with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

3. **Push the Docker Image:**
   - Push the tagged image to Google Container Registry:
     ```bash
     docker push gcr.io/<your-project-id>/streamlit-app:latest
     ```

## **Deploy to Google Cloud Run**

With your image pushed, itâ€™s time to deploy it.

1. **Deploy the App:**
   - Use the following command to deploy your app:
     ```bash
     gcloud run deploy streamlit-app \
       --image gcr.io/<your-project-id>/streamlit-app:latest \
       --platform managed \
       --region <your-region> \
       --allow-unauthenticated
     ```
   - Replace `<your-project-id>` and `<your-region>` (e.g., `us-central1`) with your actual values.

2. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - Google Cloud Run will deploy your app and provide a URL where you can access it once the deployment is complete.

## **Access and Monitor Your App**

Letâ€™s check that your app is live and monitor its performance.

1. **Access the App:**
   - Open the URL provided by Cloud Run to access your deployed app (e.g., `https://<your-app-url>`).

2. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Use **Google Cloud Monitoring** and **Logging** tools to keep track of app performance and logs.

## **Updating and Scaling**

Keep your app up-to-date and scalable.

1. **Update Your App:**
   - Make changes to your app, rebuild the Docker image, push it to Google Container Registry, and redeploy using the same `gcloud run deploy` command.

2. **Auto-Scaling:**
   - Google Cloud Run automatically scales based on traffic. No manual intervention needed.

## **Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions**

Automate updates to your app with GitHub Actions.

### **Enable Required Google Cloud APIs:**
   - Ensure the following APIs are enabled:
     - Cloud Build API
     - Cloud Run API
     - Container Registry API

### **Set Up Service Account and Permissions:**
   - Create a service account in Google Cloud Console with the roles:
     - `Cloud Run Admin`
     - `Storage Admin`
     - `Viewer`
     - `Cloud Build Editor`
   - Generate a JSON key for the service account.

### **Store Secrets in GitHub:**
   - In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and Variables** > **Actions**.
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `GCP_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud project ID.
     - `GCP_SA_KEY`: JSON key content.
     - `GCP_REGION`: Region for Cloud Run (e.g., `us-central1`).
     - `GCP_RUN_SERVICE`: Name of your Cloud Run service.

### **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your GitHub repository:
     ```yaml
     name: Deploy to Cloud Run

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Google Cloud SDK
           uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0
           with:
             project_id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT }}
             service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}

         - name: Configure Docker for Google Cloud
           run: gcloud auth configure-docker

         - name: Build and Push Docker image
           run: |
             docker build -t gcr.io/${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT }}/streamlit-app .
             docker push gcr.io/${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT }}/streamlit-app

         - name: Deploy to Cloud Run
           run: |
             gcloud run deploy ${{ secrets.GCP_RUN_SERVICE }} \
               --image gcr.io/${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT }}/streamlit-app \
               --platform managed \
               --region ${{ secrets.GCP_REGION }} \
               --allow-unauthenticated
     ```

### **Test the Continuous Deployment:**
   - Push changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository to trigger the workflow.
   - Monitor the GitHub Actions tab for workflow status and logs. You should see something similar to the image below
