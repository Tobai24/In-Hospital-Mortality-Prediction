# ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

## About the Dataset

This project uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle for predicting in-hospital mortality, focusing on ICU patient data. The original dataset contained **51 columns**, but I reduced it to **24 columns** for ease of use and to focus on the most relevant clinical features. The reduced dataset is stored in the `processed_data.csv` file in this directory.

- **Number of records**: 1,178 ICU stays
- **Original number of features**: 51 columns  
- **Reduced number of features**: 24 columns

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Column

- **Outcome**: This is the target column representing the in-hospital mortality outcome.
  - **0**: Patient survived.
  - **1**: Patient deceased.

### ðŸ§¬ Column Descriptions

Below is a detailed description of the **24 columns** used in this project (found in `processed_data.csv`):

## Usage

Before using this dataset, make sure to download the original dataset from the Kaggle link above, and also use the reduced version (`processed_data.csv`) for analysis. The reduced dataset focuses on the critical features for predicting in-hospital mortality. For detailed preprocessing steps, refer to the code provided in the `notebooks/` directory.
